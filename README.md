# MSDS601 Final Project â€” Causal Inference Interactive Blog (Dash)

This repository contains a Plotly Dash application that presents a blog-style writeup on causal inference alongside an interactive section. It was cloned from `ahklaus/msds601_final_project` and configured to run locally on Windows.

## Quickstart (Windows / PowerShell)

```bash
# 1) Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 2) Activate it
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3) Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) Run the app
python app.py
```

After starting, the Dash development server prints a local URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8050`). Open it in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Dash application with blog content and an interactive example using Plotly Express.
- `assets/`: Static assets used by the app (e.g., images). Dash automatically serves files in this folder.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies pinned for reproducibility.
- `README.md`: Setup and usage instructions.

## Notes

- The app uses Bootstrap theme `LUX` via `dash-bootstrap-components`.
- Replace the example interactive section with your own simulation, callbacks, and figures as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- If PowerShell blocks script execution when activating the venv, you may need to allow local scripts:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Then re-run activation: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

- If ports are busy, set a custom port:
```powershell
$env:PORT=8060
python app.py
```
